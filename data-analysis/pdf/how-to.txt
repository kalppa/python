 hat the labs wanted to know was: what separates the star  
 from the average performer? Is it innate or can star performance  
 be  learned?  Could  a  program  to  improve  productivity  be  designed  

that would help turn average performers into stars?
N
ot just companies are asking these questions.

have met few professionals who do not want to be more produc

H

credentials: 3.8 G

 s (grade point averages) from top-ranked  

 undergraduate programs in electrical engineering; summer  

internships at computer companies; and glowing recommenda
-
 tions from professors. Y et they took distinctly different  

approaches to their first six-month assignment. Mornings, they 

 took classes in telephone technology and the methods Bell Labs  

uses to conduct its work. 
A
 fternoons were spent on break-in  

projectsŠwork that needed to be done but that would not jeop
-
 ardize crucial projects if done badly .  
H
 enry holed up in his office as if writing his dissertation or  
studying for a law bar exam. 
H
 e collected volumes of technical  

 documents to acquaint himself with the latest ideas, surfacing  

only for a bathroom break or a mandatory staff meeting. ﬁ
W
 hat™ s  

 going to count,ﬂ he remembered thinking at the time, ﬁis whether  

 I can prove to my co-workers how technically smart I am.ﬂ  
 Lai set aside 3 hours each afternoon to work on her assignment  
 and  to  sharpen  her  technical  skills.  In  whatever  time  was  left  of  

 her workday , she introduced herself to co-workers and asked  
 questions about their projects. If one of them needed a hand or  
 was facing schedule pressures, she volunteered to help. Lai was  

 new to the work place culture, but even so her colleagues warmed  

 to her willingness to pitch in, especially given that their problems  

were not hers.
O
 ne afternoon, a colleague was struggling with a recalcitrant  
 program  for a software project due the next week. Lai had picked  

 up a new programming tool in an advanced course, and she  

 thought it  could handle the problem. 
S
 o  she offered  to work  on  

the program while her colleague focused on the larger project. 
O
 n  

 another occasion, some sophisticated software tools had to  be 

 installed on everyone™ s office 
P
C. 
S
 tandard practice was for each  
P
 C user to do the job by trial and error . 
H
 aving run into the same  

 cumbersome procedure during an internship, Lai thought it more  

 sensible for one person to install the tools in all the machines, and  

 s he  of f er e d t o d o th e  jo b.  Bu t  t h e i ns t al l a ti on s  p r ov e d u ne x pe c t

 edly  tough, requiring  two  weeks rather than  the four  days she  had  

 planned. Lai could have backed off but she saw it through, even  

 though she had to come in early and stay late for several days so  

 that neither her work assignment nor her class work would suffer .    
A
fter six months, 
H
 enry and Lai had finished their technical  
classes and their first assignments. 
T
 heir projects were successful  

 an d ju dg ed t ec hni ca ll y co mp et ent . In de ed , 
H
 e nr y™ s wo rk m ay  

 have been slightly more technically proficient than Lai™ s.  
But in the work place, 
H
enry came up short. 
W
 hile known as  
 a nice guy , he was also pegged as a loner . 
H
e was seen as techni
-
 cally adept, but his ability to share his skills with co-workers was  

questioned. 
H
e carried on as if still in school, where the individ
-
 ual™ s performance is what counts.  
 But Lai came across as someone who took initiative, who saw  
 severa l problems and stepped forwar d to solve t hem even  

 though they were not her responsibility . 
S
 he had created the  

 impression of being in the lab group for far longer than six  

months. Managers of course noticed she was showing the char
-
 acteristics of a star engineer and already were viewing her as a  

candidate for fast-track assignments. 
A
 s  se en  in the  qu iz  on  ﬁ
U

most people (like 
H
 enry) have preconceptions about what causes  

 star productivity , and most of their notions are as wrong as can  

be. 
O
 ver the past 14 years, we have debunked many common  

 myths and made some startling discoveries about the outstanding  

 engineer . 
O
 ne of our first findings was that workers and their  

bosses tend to disagree on who the star performers are. 
W

asked managers to list their choices. 
W

 account  the  number of  awards,  honors, and  performance bonuses  

 won,  as  well  as  patent  or  publication  credits  where  applicable.  

T
 hese undisputed stars were the group we studied and whose  

performance was the basis for our research.
T

 differ , our research team asked top executives, middle managers,  

engineers, and other researchers for their opinions.

T

 age, and a feeling of personal control over one™ s destiny; social fac
-
 tors, such  as interpersonal  skills  and leadership; and work and 

 organizational factors, such as the worker™ s relationship with the  

 boss, job satisfaction, and attitudes toward pay and other rewards.  
N
 ext,  to  figure  out  which  of  the  45  factors  differentiated  
between the groups, we put hundreds of star and average perform

 day battery  of tests.

 between members of the two groups.  
 Y et,  by  recognizing  this,  had  we  not  discovered  something  
critically important? 
T
 hat the four factors we presumed were vital  

to star performanceŠcognitive, psychological, social, and orga
-
nizational characteristicsŠwere not the real drivers at all?
T
 he long-term value of our effort was that it laid to rest the cloud  
of myths around star performance [see quiz, p. 58]. 
A
 nd in fact, over  

 the next years of our research, we learned that other factors were at  

 play .  Most  engineers  come  to  the  workplace  with  more  than  enough  

 potential to succeed splendidly , but most end up as run-of-the-mill.  

T

 productivityŠmuch like turning potential energy into kinetic

Nine work strategies

 to your intellectual capital, what must you do to dazzle everyone?  
P

T

gies were taught nowhere, not in school or on the job. 
F
 or the  
 most part, it was a matter of trial and error . But many technically  

 competent  engineers  make  too  many  productivity  errors  to  end  

up as more than average. 
F
 or example, they fail to take initiatives  

or take initiatives of no importance to the organization.
W

work quite differently from the pack. 
T
 hey weave their starring  

 strategies into a consistent pattern of day-to-day behavior . But  

 any engineer with the necessary smarts and motivation can  

 acquire their power .
A
 ll the same, no Big Bang revelation unleashes this kind of  
 productivity . 
N
 o magic pill or silver bullet will blast you to the  

top. Instead, stellar performance is based on a set of nine inter
-
 locking  work  strategies. 
T
 hey  are  ranked  in  order  of  importance  
and synthesized into an expert model.
1. Blazing trails
W
 ha t di d you t hin k of 
H
 enry  and Lai? 
D
 id yo u se e 
H
 e nry™ s 
 emphasis on just technical competence as undervalued or Lai as  

 being rewarded for , well, schmoozing?  
A
 ver age  per for mer s, l ike  
H
 en ry , i mag ine  ini tia tive  is  com ing  
 up  with  ideas  for doing their  job better  or volunteering for little  

extras in the workplace, like planning the annual picnic or recruit
-
 ing people  for  the  blood  drive.  Indeed, 
H
 enry  believed he  was  
 taking initiative. ﬁI gathered up the latest technical information  

 and learned about the latest software tools so that I could do a  

bang-up job on my assignment. 
N
 obody told me to do any of  

that,ﬂ he told us.
W
hat Lai understood, and 
H
 enry did not, is that only certain  
actions earn the initiative label. 
S
 tar -quality initiative means:



(as when Lai installed the 
P
C software), while still completing 

 your core assignment.  

 l a r g e r  g r o u p ,  a s  w h e n  L a i  o f f e r e d  t o  h e l p  f i x  t h e  s o f t w a r e  p r o g r a m  

 on her co-workers™ project.  



 important work often pops up, grabbing your share of it, and  

 doing a bang-up job on it.  



 through  to  successful  implementation,  as  Lai  did  when  she  

worked the extra days necessary to install the new office software.
Many average performers suppose the only worthwhile initia
-
 tives  are  on  the  order  of  inventing  a  commercially  successful  new  

 product, like the object-oriented Java language. If something will  

 not  m ake  th e f ront -pa ge of

 line proclaiming a steep climb in bottom-line profits, then it isn™ t  

worth the effort.
S
tar performers in our studies were adamant that while they 
 are always looking for roof-raising initiatives,  the small, day-to-

 day efforts had the same impact over time. Moreover , they  

noted that the whopper initiatives tend to follow a long string 

 of lesser efforts. If the work climate you create does not value  

 small initiatives, they will dry up and the big ones will never get  

 a chance to happen. Lai™ s helping-hand initiative, for instance,  

 may have given a co-worker the breathing space needed to  
make a meaningful breakthrough.
T
 he stars also believe that expectations about the initiative you  
may take hinge on your level of experience. 
A
 s a new employee,  
 Lai  was not expected to take big initiatives, but her record of  

 taking smaller ones pleasantly surprised her co-workers and soon  

 established her reputation as a productive engineer . 
A
 s she gains  

 more experience, Lai will be expected to take on higher -level  

 initiatives of greater difficulty and riskiness.

not lock themselves within a rigid job description. 
T
 hey want  

 colleagues, like Lai, who are willing to step into the gaps between  

 jobs  because  they  know  that  if  the  new  worker  does  less  than  her  

 or his share, the rest of them will have to carry more of the load.  

T
 hey need people who extend themselvesŠwhether it be to their  

 colleagues, to the customers, or to the changing needs of the  

 marketplace.  
 Customers are also looking for these characteristics in the  
 employees they encounter .

2. Knowing who knows
A
 verage performers think networking just means building a  
 grapevine for learning the latest office gossip, or socializing with  

 p e o p l e  i n   t h e i r   f i e l d   a n d   w i t h  e x e c u t i v e  h e a d   h u n t e r s   w h o   c a n  

help them in future job hunting.
S
 tar producers engage in addition in a more important type of  
networking. 
A
 s they realize, the information overload of today™ s  

 society means  that  few people  know all they need to know to  get  

their jobs done. 
T
 hey know maybe 50Œ80 percent, and until they  

can make up the deficit, they are stuck. 
W
 hat helps the stars get  

unstuck is effective networking.
A
  star knows it is vital to develop ahead of time dependable  
 t wo - wa y  s t re e t s t o t he  ex p e rt s , w ho  w i l l h e lp  e a c h o th e r c om p l et e  

the tasks critical to the bottom line. 
T
 he goal is to minimize the  

 knowledge deficit that ev er y engineer discovers as she or he mea
-
sures up to a new job.
S
tars™ networks differ from typical workers™ networks in two 
important respects. 
T
 hey have the right people in them, and they  

 are faster .
T
 he people in their networks can provide the right answer the  
first time. 
A
 verage  performers get wrong answers more  frequently  
 either because they ask the wrong people or because the experts  

with the right answers are not in their networks. 
S
 o they spin their  

wheels or go down blind alleys.
T
 he faster networks get the stars unstuck and back on the task  
 sooner than the rest. If it takes a star a half-day to get an answer ,  

 it takes the others one to two days to get it and often it is wrong.  

O
ver time, these extra days add up.
 Better -connected and faster networks allow the stars to tur
-
 bo-charge their productivity , so that they outpace the average  

performers, who might have similar talent, but go it alone.
 Claudio, an information technology consultant working for  
the international consulting firm, 
A
 ndersen Consulting, was  

 assigned to  write a contract proposal to a tight deadline. 
A
 t  stake  

 was a $500 000 contract for providing information  technology  

 support for bio-assaying processes used in biotechnology firms.  
 Claudio remembered an undergraduate classmate who had  
 gone to work for Genentech Inc., the industry leader , and called  

 her .  In  turn,  she  put  him  in  touch  with  the  scientist  who  had  
 pioneered the assaying process. In just  two  afternoon  phone  calls,  
 he got the information critical for his report.

electronic bulletin board. 
W
 hen he logged into his computer  

 the  next  workday ,  40  leads  were  waiting, all of  which had to be 

 plowed through. Many of the messages contradicted one  

 another , but as he knew none of the people who responded, he

T
hus, while 
N
 ewt was still struggling with his information  
 overload,  Claudio  had  already  used his star  network  to  move  

faster and farther ahead.
T
 he current rage in many upper management circles is to  
 embrace computer intranet-ing as the high-tech solution to  

knowledge deficits. Managers spend millions of dollars on addi
-
 tional computer hardware and software, believing workers like  

N
 ewt can e-mail their way out of such quandaries. But successful  

networking is most often accomplished in one-to-one interac

 technology . 
S
 tar networking entails building, maintaining, and  

 operating within a group of experts who share knowledge for  

 mutual benefit. It has little to do with technology .  
 3. Pr oactive self-management  
A
 verage  performers  believe  self-management  means  managing  
 ti me  an d p roj ec ts  be tte r . I f t hei r work  i s d one  wi th in sc hed ul e,  

budget, and specifications, then they must be good self-managers.
S
 tar producers know that much more than time or project  
management is at stake. 
T
 hese requirements you are expected  

and paid to meet. 
T
 heir work strategy helps them proactively  

 create opportunities, direct work choic es, per form  e xtra we ll  

 on the job, and carve out a career path. It enables them to  

 develop a portfolio of talents and work experiences that  

 increases their value to the company .

W
 ith her combination of practice and experience, she certainly  
 kept up with the other new hires, but what eventually separated  

 her  from  the pack  was  her internalized  grasp  of  software  and  

computer logic. Co-workers were quick to recognize her insight

S
 uch  

 encounters gave her valuable exposure to problems she would not  

have faced in her own work.
A
 fter her first year , 
S

 a transfer to software testing, an assignment often mistakenly  

considered second-class, a career dead-end. 
T

others™ work, to determine if the software does what it should. 

T
 here is scant personal satisfaction of the kind that comes from  

creating new products. 
S
 oftware developers tolerate testers, albeit  

 reluctantly and usually defensively , as the necessary bearers of bad  
 newsŠidentifying bugs and checking for quality .  
But 
S
 arah saw the tester job as a chance to understand her work  
 from  a fresh and crucial perspective. 
S
 he would become familiar  
 with a  wider range of  problems  that could make software fail. 
S
 he  
would gain years™ worth of experience in just a year or two.

A

-
 tionship  with  people  having  organizational  authority  and  power  

 over  themŠmeans  showing  managers  and  co-workers  that  they  

 know how to toe the line, take orders without question, and not  

 threaten the leader .  
S
tar producers learn very early the importance of a more pos
-
itive form of followership, of being a good 
N
 o. 2Šthat it is often  

 m or e  im p or t an t  t o  ma k e  th e  as s is t  th a n t h e s c or e . 
T
 h ey  a re  
 actively engaged in helping the organization (and usually the  

 leader) succeed, while exercising independent, critical judgment  

 about  what  needs  to be  done  and  how to  do  it. 
S
 tar  followers  
 work cooperatively with a leader to accomplish the organization™ s  

 goals even when there are personality or workplace differences.  
T
 his finding was surprising since it contradicts what many  
people thinkŠthat a star is always a leader or the center of atten
-
 t i o n .  
O

 her to trouble spots, by serving as a thoughtful sounding board,  

 or by challenging the leader™ s decisions.
 In many technology companies, a fine  line must be walked  
 between what the company believes the customer wants and what  
 the knowledge workers think is best. I often hear bosses complain  

that their engineers are building a 
R
olls 
R
 oyce when the customer  

only needs a 
D
odge. 
E
 namored of their ability to build the best,  

 workers want to attach all the latest bells and whistles, even  

 though this can lead to delays or budget overruns.  
In one such exchange, a star engineer at Bell Labs had to con
-
 front the boss™ s nagging about his extra efforts. 
T
 he boss wanted  

 to ship a stripped-down call-routing feature for the telephone  

 switch in order to come in ahead of schedule and win points with  

 the customer .
ﬁ
F
orget about all the extras. 
T
 he customer would rather have  
 a basic model today than the greatest model one month from  

 now ,ﬂ she said.
N
 ot necessarily , said the star performer , and sat down with her  
 to  review  the  product™ s  short-  and  long-term  goals  for  this  cus
-
 tomer and others in the marketplace.  
ﬁ
S
 ure, there might be short-term gains with this customer ,ﬂ said  
 the follower , ﬁbut there are risks, too. 
T
 hey may relegate us to the  

 low end of the line when we have staked out the high-end market.  

A
 lso, if we do the extr a wo rk on th is customer™ s product now , we™ll  

 save on product development time for other customers already in  

 the pipeline. But let™ s find out what the customer prefers.ﬂ
O

A
 t the same time, he tried to shift her perspective to the larger  

overall goals they shared. 
W
 hen possible, such followers temper  
 their own  efforts so  that they  fall  in  the  range  of  company objec
-
tivesŠor they find an organization that is a better match.
 6. T eamwork as joint ownership of a pr oject
A
verage performers think teamwork means working coopera
-
 tively with others on a project or problem and doing your part  
on the team.
S
tar producers take it to a higher level. 
T
 hey see it as a complex  
 series of skills that involve taking joint ﬁownershipﬂ of goal-setting,  

group commitments, work activities, schedules, and group accom
-
 plishments. It also means being a positive contributor to the group™ s  

 dynamicsŠhelping everyone feel part of the team, dealing with  

conflict, and assisting others in solving problems.
A
  medical equipment supplier formed a crisis team because  
 hospitals were furious over recent failures in the companies™ latest  

critical care monitors. 
T
he equipment gave off emergency warn
-
ings at random, distressing both patients and the hospital staff 

 who would rush into triage alert only to find nothing wrong.  
 
T
 he  team consisted of professionals  from five departments,  
including production, research, and customer service. 
O
 f the  

 g ro up ™ s  s ev en  m e mb er s,  t he  o nl y st ar  w as  
A
 i de n,  an  en gi ne er  w ho  
 had moved into customer service to learn more about that side of  

 the business.  
D
 uring the third hour of the first team meeting, a heated debate  
 erupted over what action should be taken immediately . 
E
 wing, a  

 53-year -old production engineer with 25 years of experience at the  
 company , argued for continuing to send repair people to the disaf
-
 fected  hospitals  to  fix  the  machines  on  site.  But  Julie,  a  recent  hire

 Johnson™ s lead from the

T
he discussion dragged on, with 
E
 wing and Julie getting more  
heated and less civil. 
A
iden noticed that he and others were get

 ting frustrated and fidgety . 
R
 ather than let the matter go  

 unchecked, he mentioned it, and upon getting nods of agreement  

from several of the others, he suggested, ﬁ
W
 hy don™ t we take a  

10-minute break, so that we can all take a breather and maybe 

find a way around this?ﬂ
W
hen the meeting resumed, 
A
 iden thought he could break the  
impasse by asking Julie to present and argue for 
E
 wing™ s approach  

and getting 
E
wing to argue hers. 
A
lthough both Julie and 
E

 were wary , the tactic defused the mounting tension and anger .

 7. Small-l leadership  
A
 verage performers are fascinated by leadership with a big  
L: Big 
V
ision, Big Charisma, Big 
S
uccess. 
T
 o them, leadership  
 seems an in-born trait whose owners can flaunt their egos by  

 being in charge, having the power to make most key decisions,  

 and delegating whatever does not interest them.  
S
 tar performers, on the other hand, view leadership as a work  
 strategy that builds on expe rt ise and influence to convince a  

group of people to unite on a substantial task. 
T
 he undertaking  

 can involve a range of effortsŠhelping the group create a clear  

 vision of where they want to go along with the high commitment  
and trust necessary to get there; finding the resources to accom
-
 plish  the  task;  and  shepherding  the  project  to  successful  comple
-
 tion.  
W
 e all know very smart people who couldn™ t lead a one-car  
funeral. 
O
 ther critical skills besides intelligence are involved in  
leadership with a small l. 
S
 mall-l leaders understand the human  

 relationships that link people to each other , whereas Big Ls are  

 much too focused on their own ideas, their own work styles, their  

own goals. 
S
 mall-l leaders know they need to take into account  

 the needs, skills, aspirations, and power of their co-workers on a  

project or team.
T
 his focus outside the self is productive because of a work  
 place  reality  that  Big  Ls  often  overlook. 
S
 mall-l  leaders  seldom  
 h ave  f or ma l au th or it y ov er  t ho se  t he y wan t  to  l ea d.  
P
 e er s wi ll  g o  
 along only if they believe a member of the group who wants to  

 lead is acting in their interest as much as his or her own. Bringing  

 them  around  requires  the  kind  of  interaction  that  Big  Ls  believe  

is a waste of precious leadership time. 
T
 he small-l leader who  

 bonds with co-worker followers by slogging through the daily  

 project  grind and sharing late-night  pizzas while  meeting dead
-
 lines earns more loyalty and credibility than even the  most char
-
 ismatic Big L boss.  
T
 he big secret here from our star performersŠthe secret that  
separates them from Big Ls and other average-performing lead
-
 ersŠis  their  refusal  to  assume  they  know  everything  about  other  

people. Most Big L hype portrays the leader as omniscient. 
T
 he  

 Leader knows what™ s best for the followers and for the situation.  
O
ur star performers make a habit of asking first, even when 
 they think they already know .

 assigned to lead six co-workers in a project to develop a new  

 software  program  for  the  Internet,  she  took  time  out  from  the  first  
meeting to ask about work roles and assignments.
 ﬁJohn, during our last project together , you said that you  
 wanted  more  hardware  experience.  Is  that  still  the  case?  Because  

this project has a strong hardware component to it.ﬂ
Like a perceptive psychologist, 
A
 nithia suspended her own  
 assumptions and asked empowering, open-ended questions that  

 got people talking about what skills each brought to the table and  

 what  each  one  wanted  from  the  project. 
A
 s  a  result,  she  was  able  
 to match work assignments to individual skills and interests more

O
 f course, employees cannot always get everything they want.  
 But with the sincere offer to listen and the attempt to meet some  

needs a small-l leader without formal authority wins a lot of influ

ence. 
T
 hose  efforts  also  provide  the  firm  platform  needed  when  the  
 inevitable  stresses  hit  during  the  project™ s  crunch  times. 
D
emon
-
 strated superiority in a technical area may in any case justify some  

 small-l stars in becoming an interim leader . But they know that  

 hierarchy does not extend to the interpersonal side, where instead,  

they try to create a we™re-all-in-the-trenches-together attitude.
T

A

acted as small-l leader proved a huge hit with customers.

 past. If the company had 500 more like her , he said, domination  

of the

T
 hen, he summoned her to  

the podium to speak.
Like so many self-important actors clutching their 
O
 scars,  
A
 nithia could have rushed through the standard nice words about  

 her boss and project members. Instead, she invited them all on  

 stage with her and asked one of them to introduce each member  

of the group. 
T

how-and-

 noticed by upper management through slick presentations,  

 long-winded memos, and public displays of affection for their  

own work. 
T

S
 tar producers use a series of skills involving selecting which  
 information to pass on to which others and developing the most  

 effective, user -friendly format for reaching and persuading a spe

cific audience. 
A
t its highest level, 
S
how-and-
T
ell involves select
-
 ing either the right message for a particular audience or the right  

audience for the particular message.
T
here is no getting around it. 
T
 he economy of the 1990s is a  
 tough place for professionals who have trouble presenting their ideas  

to groups, especially in personal presentations. 
F
 or most knowledge  

 workers, we™re not talking about big productions, like Bill Gates or  

 B i l l y  G r a h a m  a d d r e s s i n g  t h o u s a n d s  i n  c a v e r n o u s  c o n v e n t i o n  h a l l s

conference room presentations to groups of five to 20, with an occa

T
 he  audience  is  co-work

 ers, or upper -level managers, or customers. 
T
 he content is usually  

 technical and product-related.  
 In the realm of the star producer , though, the process is  
more sophisticated.

T
 he stars we observed  

 had mastered the ability to deliver a message to a targeted  

 audience, to persuade listeners to accept the message, and to  

 be proactive in deflecting criticism.  
W
 here  average  performers  fail  most  often  is  in  making  the  
 leap from the basic dispensing of information to the high level  

of using the message to influence. 
T
 heir style and framework  

 of delivery remains the same even though their audiences can  

differ a lot in makeup.

 impressive  growth  and that  stockholders would  hardly take  kindly  

to a protracted strike.

 both management and the rank-and-file approved the health care

Quiz on
 ‚Understanding Star Performers™  
I
 ndividuals who outperform their colleagues by a wide margin are often  
called ﬁstar performers.ﬂ 
H
 ow much do you know about these individuals?

re the following statements 
T
rue or False?
_____1) 
S
tar performers are born, not made.
_____2) 
   S

Qs, are better problem solvers, or are more creative).
_____3) 
S

_____4) 
S
tar performers have more leadership skills than others.

desk people.

 etailed time management and organizational systems are keys  

 to high productivity .
 _ _ _ _ _ 7 )  
   S
 tar performers work longer hours and harder than average  

performers.
 _ _ _ _ _ 8 )  
   S
 tar performers are more satisfied with their jobs than average  

performers.
 _ _ _ _ _ 9 )  
   S
 tar performers are successful primarily because they play  

 organizational politics and give slick presentations to upper  

management.
 _ _ _ _ _ 1 0 )  
 
 Minorities and women can seldom be as productive as people who  
are part of the ﬁold boyﬂ network.
 _ _ _ _ _ 1 1 )  
 
 People cannot sustain a doubled rate of productivity improvement  
for long time periods.
 

_____12) 
   I
  would rather have a team with one star performer supported  

 by four average performers than a team with five performers who  

are all in the top 5 percent.
A
 nswers: 1)F; 2)F; 3)F; 4)F; 5)F; 6)F; 7)F; 8)F; 9)F; 10)F; 11)F .
S
core: 
 
10 to 11 Š you know what leads to star performance
 
8 to 9  Š above average
 
 
5 to 7  Š average understanding of star performance
 
    
0 to 4 Š your understanding of what leads to star performance is
 
limited and probably based on unfounded, naïve assumptions
 
about stars.
 Question 12 does not have a right or wrong answer . 
I
 t does indicate whether  
 you believe in one star to lead to success or in having a group of top  

 performers from which one  or more stars may emerge. 
I
 n today™ s highly  
competitive world, the latter strategy is more likely to give you an edge.
S
tar Performer productivity is not the result of innate traitsŠlike 
I
 Q,  
 personality , or character . Productivity depends on how they do their jobs.  

T
 he everyday work strategies of the star performers, not gimmicky products  

 or  working long hours,  make  the  dif ference. 
W
 hen  certain star  performer  
 strategies are systematically integrated into everyday work routines, then  

 productivity improvement rates can double. For those groups excluded  
from the ﬁold boysﬂ network, like minorities and women, productivity 
improvement rates can increase 400 percent.
